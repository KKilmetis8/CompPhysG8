*[Introductory paragraph]*
This code was made to simulate Argon atoms at different states of matter by changing densities and temperatures. The atoms are simulated to be in a pseudo-infinite box by implementing the Minimal Image Convention, which creates a periodic-boundary effect similar to the classic arcade game """".

## How to Use

### Running different states of matter

### Running a custom configuration

Run

```python
python3 'simulation.py'
```

Don't touch anything else

### Outputs
