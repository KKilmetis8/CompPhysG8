# Computational Physics: Group 8

**Authors**: Konstantinos Kilmetis and Diederick Vroom

This GitHub repository includes the efforts of group 8 of the MSc course "Computational Physics" at Leiden University, year 2024, for each project conducted during the duration of the course:

**Project 1: Molecular Dynamics**, simulating different phases of Argon atoms in a pseudo-infinite box as by the Lennard-Jones potential.
*Achieved grade: 9.3/10*

**Project 2: The Ising Model**, a Monte-Carle Markov-Chain implementation on the 2D Ising model.
*Achieved grade: 9.5/10*

**Project 3: Nuclear-Reaction Network**, simulating the pp-chain and CNO-cycle occurring in the interior of stars, for different temperatures and metallicites.
*Achieved grade: TBD/10*
